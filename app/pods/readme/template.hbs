# Getting Started

This is a living style guide demonstrating _components_ and _layouts_ used in the project created by movento.

![movento logo](/assets/images/logo-movento.png 'movento')

The _README.md_ document in the root folder of this project is a **required** read so you learn how to work with this Ember Sandbox and Ember in general.

This content for this section was written in [Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
We can use markdown-notation in our components and routes when we apply the `{{md-text}}` tag, offered to use through the _[Ember-Freestyle](https://github.com/chrislopresto/ember-freestyle)_ project.
